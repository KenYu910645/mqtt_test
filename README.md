Minor example using [MQTT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mqtt) and Python.

## Requirements
Requires [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/) to be installed.

install paho-mqtt:
$pip install paho-mqtt

On Linux with the **apt-get** package manager:

    sudo apt-get install mosquitto
    sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients

**Note**: ``mosquitto-clients`` is to get the **mosquitto_pub** to make it simple to try stuff from the command line. You could leave it out and only use the supplied ``publisher.py``.

Also install [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) if you want to use it (recommended):

    sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv


## Setup
The use of virtualenv is optional but recommended for playing around with this example code.

Simply clone this repo, setup virtualenv and use pip to install requirements.

    git clone https://github.com/roppert/mosquitto-python-example.git
    cd mqtt-mosquitto-example
    virtualenv .
    source bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Test the subscriber example
First start the subscriber which will enter a loop waiting for new messages:

    ./subscriber.py

Then open a new terminal and send a message:

    mosquitto_pub -d -h localhost -q 0 -t adult/pics -m "can i haz moar kittenz"

This should generate a message in the terminal running the subscriber.

Take a look at **publisher.py** to see how to publish messages using python. Or just open another terminal and run it from command line while **subscriber.py** is running:

    source bin/activate
    ./publisher.py


## Configure SSL/TLS

See [mosquitto-tls](http://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-tls-7.html) on how to generate certificates and keys.

Once created you need to adjust **/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf** and **subscriber.py** accordingly and then use **mosquitto_pub** with cert and key:

    mosquitto_pub -d -h localhost --cafile root.ca --cert c1.crt --key c1.key -q 0 -t adult/pics -m "can i haz moar kittenz"
