# client.max_inflight_messages_set(self, inflight) Defaults to 20. Increasing this value will consume more memory but can increase throughput.
# client.max_queued_messages_set(self, queue_size) Defaults to 0. 0 means unlimited. When the queue is full, any further outgoing messages would be dropped.

# client.message_retry_set(retry) # Set the time in seconds before a message with QoS>0 is retried, if the broker does not respond.
# This is set to 5 seconds by default and should not normally need changing
# client.enable_logger(logger=None)
# client.username_pw_set(username, password=None) Set a username and optionally a password for broker authentication.
# client.user_data_set(userdata) Set the private user data that will be passed to callbacks when events are generated. Use this for your own purpose to support your application.
# client.will_set(topic, payload=None, qos=0, retain=False) Set a Will to be sent to the broker. If the client disconnects without calling disconnect(), the broker will publish the message on its behalf.
# client.reconnect_delay_set(min_delay=1, max_delay=120) The client will automatically retry connection. Between each attempt it will wait a number of seconds between min_delay and max_delay.
#When the connection is lost, initially the reconnection attempt is delayed of min_delay seconds. Itâ€™s doubled between subsequent attempt up to max_delay.
